### Project Description
[Mood Maker is a fun and useless web app designed to ruin your mood ‚Äî in the most entertaining way possible. Instead of cheering you up, it does the opposite: it gives you voice-based insults, sarcastic messages, and meme-style responses that roast you on demand.

You click a button ‚Äî it insults you.
You want motivation? Too bad.
This app is here to waste your time and make you laugh at your own pain.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Most apps are built to make people happy, focused, and productive.

But what if someone wants the opposite?

What if you want to be insulted, roasted, and totally unmotivated ‚Äî just for fun?

There‚Äôs no app that exists for that. No voice insults. No brutal memes. Nothing that simply ruins your mood on purpose.

That‚Äôs a problem no one really has‚Ä¶
But we decided to fix it anyway.]
